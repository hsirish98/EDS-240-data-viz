## Picking ggplot() themes

If you are emphasizing/investigating ONLY trends and not the absolute values of the underlying data, then going as minimalist as possible is a good move.

When you have crowded data on a scatter plot, for example, it's good to mess with the transparency of the dots. You can also change the shapes to differentiate the "dots" a little bit. Also good for colorblindness, etc.

In general, you'll want to avoid using a gray/darker background unless it's helpful for the eye to discern between colors of the data.

Try to avoid 3D graphics as much as possible. It rarely works except for something that is naturally intuitive re: 3D such as elevation
